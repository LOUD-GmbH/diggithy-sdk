DIGGITHY SDK aims to make integration with DIGGITY easy.

## Installation

```shell script
npm install @diggithy/sdk
```

## Contributions

In order to contribute to this package, please create a PR with the proposed changes.

We are using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to facilitate CD.

After running `npm install`, there are git hooks installed which help you with committing.
Although git hooks should be installed automatically, it makes sense to ensure that with running `npm rebuild husky`.

Just work as you are used to and if you want to commit, run `git commit`.
[Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) will then ask you about the changes you made to generate a commit
message for you.
